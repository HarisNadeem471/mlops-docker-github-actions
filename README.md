# MLOps Docker GitHub Actions 🚀

This project demonstrates the process of containerizing a basic Machine Learning (ML) application using **Docker** and automating its deployment with **GitHub Actions**. Upon pushing the code to the repository, a GitHub Actions workflow is triggered to:
1. Build a Docker image of the ML app.
2. Push the Docker image to **Docker Hub**.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HarisNadeem471/mlops-docker-github-actions.git
cd mlops-docker-github-actions

2️⃣ Set Up the Environment
Install required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the app:
python app.py

🐳 Dockerizing the Application
1️⃣ Build the Docker Image
docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/mlops-app .

2️⃣ Run the Docker Container
docker run -p 5000:5000 your-dockerhub-username/mlops-app


🔄 GitHub Actions Workflow
A CI/CD pipeline is set up using GitHub Actions:

Trigger: On every push to the main branch.
Steps:
Build the Docker image.
Push the image to Docker Hub.

📌 Future Enhancements
Add unit tests for ML models.
Deploy the app to AWS/GCP using Kubernetes.
